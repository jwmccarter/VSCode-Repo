# VSCode-Repo
This is a test of git and VSCode working together.

I'm making this change on VS Code.

Making another addition in VSC.  Let's see if this uploads.

<!-- Going to try to fork it. -->
<!--  I commented that out then -->


But what if I do THIS now?  Is it a new change?

Can I do this, committ, then sync? (Without saying publish?)

Yes, you can sync!


I'm going to try to add this:

for (int a; a < 5; a++){
    Serial.println("This is great!);
}

That's it!

Yes, this works!  I want to save it to the project!  That's called a Committ.
