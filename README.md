# VSCode-Repo
This is a test of git and VSCode working together.

I'm making this change on VS Code.

Making another addition in VSC.  Let's see if this uploads.

<!-- Going to try to fork it. -->
<!--  I commented that out then -->


But what if I do THIS now?  Is it a new change?

Can I do this, committ, then sync? (Without saying publish?)
